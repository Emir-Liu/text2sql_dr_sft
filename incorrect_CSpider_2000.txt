It then filters the results to only include students who do not own a cat as a pet, and groups the results by the `Major` column. Finally, it calculates the average age of each major group using the `AVG` aggregation function.Note that this query assumes that the `PetType` column in the `Pets` table contains the type of pet (e.g. 'cat', 'dog', etc.). If the column contains a different type of data, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include pets whose owner is older than 1.Note that this query assumes that the `Pets` table has a column called `weight` and that the `Has_Pet` table has a column called `PetID`.

The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average age, and the `MAX` function is used to calculate the maximum age. The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by the type of pet.For example, if the `Pets` table contains the following data:```PetID  PetType  pet_age  weight1      Dog      3        152      Dog      5        183      Cat      2        84      Cat      4        125      Fish     1        0.56      Fish     3        1```The query will return the following results:```PetType  AverageAge  MaxAgeDog      4          5Cat      3          4Fish     2          3```This shows that the average age for dogs is 4, the maximum age for dogs is 5, the average age for cats is 3, the maximum age for cats is 4, and the average age for fish is 2, and the maximum age for fish is 3.

The `FullName` column will contain the full name of each car maker, the `Id` column will contain the unique identifier for each car maker, and the `num_models` column will contain the number of models produced by each car maker.For example, if the `car_makers` table contains the following rows:```Id | FullName---|----------1  | Toyota2  | Honda3  | Ford```And the `model_list` table contains the following rows:```ModelId | Maker | Model--------|-------|--------1       | 1     | Camry2       | 1     | Corolla3       | 2     | Civic4       | 3     | F-150```Then the result set of the query above would be:```FullName | Id | num_models---------|----|-----------Toyota   | 1  | 2Honda    | 2  | 1Ford     | 3  | 1```This shows that Toyota produces two models, Honda produces one model, and Ford produces one model.

The `COUNT(DISTINCT ml.Model)` function counts the number of distinct models produced by each car maker.The result of this query will be a list of car makers, along with their id, full name, and the number of models they produce. For example:```Id  FullName                                 NumModels--  ----------------------------------------  ----------1   Toyota Motor Corporation                     102   Honda Motor Co., Ltd.                       103   Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.                      84   Ford Motor Company                          75   General Motors Company                      66   Volkswagen AG                                57   BMW AG                                      48   Mercedes-Benz Cars                          39   Hyundai Motor Group                         210  Kia Motors Corporation                      2```Note that the `COUNT(DISTINCT ml.Model)` function is used to count the number of distinct models produced by each car maker, rather than the number of rows in the `model_list` table.

We can do this by joining the `car_names` table with the `model_list` table on the `Model` column and then filtering out the cars that have more than 3 cylinders.```SELECT c.MakeId, c.MakeFROM car_names cJOIN model_list m ON c.Model = m.ModelWHERE m.Cylinders <= 3;```This will give us the `MakeId` and `Make` of the cars that have more than the lowest horsepower and do not have more than 3 cylinders.Finally, we can combine these two queries to get the desired result.```SELECT c.MakeId, c.MakeFROM cars_data cJOIN car_names n ON c.MakeId = n.MakeIdWHERE c.Horsepower > (SELECT MIN(c2.Horsepower) FROM cars_data c2)AND NOT EXISTS (  SELECT 1  FROM model_list m  WHERE c.Model = m.Model AND m.Cylinders > 3);```This will give us the `MakeId` and `Make` of the cars that have more than the lowest horsepower and do not have more than 3 cylinders.

The `JOIN` clauses are used to link the tables based on the foreign key relationships between them. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include cars with less than 4 cylinders.Note that this query assumes that the `cars_data` table has a column called `Cylinders` that stores the number of cylinders for each car.

You can then use a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include airlines that have flights that depart from both APG and CVO airports.Here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this:```SELECT DISTINCT AirlineFROM flights f1JOIN airports a1 ON f1.SourceAirport = a1.AirportCodeJOIN airports a2 ON f1.DestAirport = a2.AirportCodeWHERE a1.City = 'APG' AND a2.City = 'CVO';```This query joins the flights table with the airports table twice, once for the source airport and once for the destination airport. It then uses a WHERE clause to filter the results to only include airlines that have flights that depart from both APG and CVO airports. The DISTINCT keyword is used to eliminate duplicate airlines from the results.Note that this query assumes that the airports table has a City column that contains the city name for each airport, and that the flights table has a SourceAirport and DestAirport column that contains the airport code for the source and destination airports, respectively. You may need to modify the query if your tables have different column names or data types.

Then, it uses a subquery to find the airports that are not APG airports. Finally, it uses the `NOT IN` operator to find the airlines that have departures from CVO but not from APG airports.The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each airline is only listed once, even if they have multiple departures from CVO but not from APG airports.Note that this query assumes that the `Airline` column in the `flights` table is the primary key, and that the `AirportCode` column in the `airports` table is the primary key.

hard pred: To find the names of the employees who never received any evaluation, you can use a SQL query that joins the `employee` and `evaluation` tables on the `Employee_ID` column, and then filters the results to only include employees who do not have any rows in the `evaluation` table.Here is an example query that should accomplish this:```SELECT e.NameFROM employee eLEFT JOIN evaluation e ON e.Employee_ID = e.Employee_IDWHERE e.Employee_ID IS NULL;```This query uses a `LEFT JOIN` to join the `employee` and `evaluation` tables on the `Employee_ID` column. The `WHERE` clause then filters the results to only include employees who do not have any rows in the `evaluation` table.Note that this query assumes that the `Employee_ID` column in the `evaluation` table is a foreign key referencing the `Employee_ID` column in the `employee` table.

extra pred: To find the name of the shop that is hiring the largest number of employees, we need to first find the number of employees hired by each shop. We can do this by joining the hiring table with the shop table on the Shop_ID column.Here is the SQL command to find the name of the shop that is hiring the largest number of employees:```SELECT s.NameFROM hiring hJOIN shop s ON h.Shop_ID = s.Shop_IDGROUP BY s.NameORDER BY COUNT(h.Employee_ID) DESCLIMIT 1;```This command joins the hiring table with the shop table on the Shop_ID column, and then groups the results by shop name. The COUNT function is used to count the number of employees hired by each shop, and the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the number of employees hired. The LIMIT clause is used to return only the first row of the result set, which is the shop that is hiring the largest number of employees.

Then, it filters the stores with less than 3000 products using the `WHERE` clause. Finally, it filters the stores with more than 10000 products using the `WHERE` clause again. The `INTERSECT` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets of districts, which will give us the districts that have both stores with less than 3000 products and stores with more than 10000 products.The result of this query will be a list of districts that have both stores with less than 3000 products and stores with more than 10000 products.

medium pred: To find the different template type codes and the number of templates that correspond to each, you can use a SQL query that joins the `Ref_Template_Types` and `Templates` tables on the `Template_Type_Code` column. Here's an example query:```SELECT tt.Template_Type_Code, COUNT(*) AS num_templatesFROM Ref_Template_Types ttJOIN Templates t ON tt.Template_Type_Code = t.Template_Type_CodeGROUP BY tt.Template_Type_Code```This query will return a result set with two columns: `Template_Type_Code` and `num_templates`. The `Template_Type_Code` column will contain the different template type codes, and the `num_templates` column will contain the number of templates that correspond to each template type code.For example, if the `Ref_Template_Types` table contains the following rows:```Template_Type_Code | Template_Type_Description----------------------------------------------1                  | Contract2                  | Agreement3                  | Proposal```And the `Templates` table contains the following rows:```Template_ID | Version_Number | Template_Type_Code | Date_Effective_From | Date_Effective_To | Template_Details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1           | 1.0            | 1                   | 2022-01-01          | 2022-12-31          | This is a contract template.2           | 1.0            | 2                   | 2022-01-01          | 2022-12-31          | This is an agreement template.3           | 1.0            | 3                   | 2022-01-01          | 2022-12-31          | This is a proposal template.4           | 1.0            | 1                   | 2022-01-01          | 2022-12-31          | This is a contract template.5           | 1.0            | 2                   | 2022-01-01          | 2022-12-31          | This is an agreement template.```The result of the query will be:```Template_Type_Code | num_templates-----------------------------------1                  | 22                  | 23                  | 1```This shows that there are two templates with template type code 1 (contract), two templates with template type code 2 (ag

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the number of templates, and the `LIMIT` clause is used to return only the first row (i.e., the template type with the most number of templates).The result of this query will be a single row with the template type code and the number of templates for that type. For example:```Template_Type_Code | num_templates------------------+---------------A                 | 10```This means that template type A has the most number of templates (10).

The `SUM` function is used to calculate the total amount spent by each visitor, and the results are ordered in descending order of the total amount spent.Note that this query assumes that the `visitor` and `visit` tables are properly joined, and that the `Total_spent` column exists in the `visit` table. If the `Total_spent` column does not exist, you can use the `SUM` function to calculate it as follows:```SELECT v.ID, v.Name, v.Level_of_membership, SUM(t.Num_of_Ticket * t.Price) AS Total_SpentFROM visitor vJOIN visit t ON v.ID = t.visitor_IDGROUP BY v.ID, v.Name, v.Level_of_membershipORDER BY Total_Spent DESC;```This query calculates the total amount spent by each visitor by multiplying the number of tickets purchased by the price of each ticket.

extra pred: To find the name of the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011, we need to use a combination of joins and subqueries.First, we need to find the museums opened before 2009 and after 2011. We can do this by using the following query:```SELECT * FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009 OR Open_Year > 2011;```This will give us the IDs of the museums opened before 2009 and after 2011.Next, we need to find the visitors who visited both of these museums. We can do this by using a subquery to find the visitors who visited one of the museums, and then using a join to find the visitors who visited both museums.```SELECT v.NameFROM visitor vJOIN visit v1 ON v.ID = v1.visitor_IDJOIN visit v2 ON v.ID = v2.visitor_IDWHERE v1.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009)AND v2.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year > 2011);```This will give us the names of the visitors who visited both museums opened before 2009 and after 2011.So, the complete SQL command to find the name of the visitor who visited both a museum opened before 2009 and a museum opened after 2011 is:```SELECT v.NameFROM visitor vJOIN visit v1 ON v.ID = v1.visitor_IDJOIN visit v2 ON v.ID = v2.visitor_IDWHERE v1.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year < 2009)AND v2.Museum_ID IN (SELECT Museum_ID FROM museum WHERE Open_Year > 2011);```

The `AVG` function is used to calculate the average of the `loser_age` and `winner_age` columns.Note that this query assumes that the `loser_age` and `winner_age` columns are of type `INT` or `SMALLINT`, which is the default data type for integer columns in most SQL databases. If the columns are of a different data type, you may need to use a different function to calculate the average, such as `AVG(CAST(loser_age AS DECIMAL(10,2)))` or `AVG(CAST(winner_age AS DECIMAL(10,2)))`.

It then filters the results to only include players who have won in both the WTA Championships and the Australian Open.The `JOIN` clause is used to combine the data from multiple tables based on a common column. In this case, we are joining the `matches` and `rankings` tables on the `player_id` column, which is the primary key in both tables. The `ON` clause specifies the column that the tables are joined on.The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results to only include players who have won in both the WTA Championships and the Australian Open. The `tourney_id` column in the `matches` table is used to identify the tournament that a player has won in, and the `tourney_id` column in the `rankings` table is used to identify the tournament that a player has been ranked in.The `SELECT` clause is used to specify the columns that we want to include in the results.

The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows where the `Cartoon` table has a row with a `Directed_by` 1 of 'Todd Casey'. The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to eliminate duplicate countries from the result set.The resulting output will be a list of countries whose TV channels are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey.

extra pred: To find the name of the country that speaks the largest number of languages, we need to join the tables `country` and `countrylanguage` on the `CountryCode` column. We can then group the results by `CountryCode` and `Language` and count the number of rows in each group. The country with the largest number of languages will have the highest count.Here is the SQL command to find the name of the country that speaks the largest number of languages:```SELECT country.NameFROM countryJOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCodeGROUP BY country.Code, countrylanguage.LanguageORDER BY COUNT(*) DESCLIMIT 1;```This command joins the `country` and `countrylanguage` tables on the `CountryCode` column, groups the results by `CountryCode` and `Language`, and orders the results by the count of rows in each group in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause is used to return only the first row of the result set, which will be the country with the largest number of languages.

We can use the following SQL query to achieve this:```SELECT continent, COUNT(DISTINCT language) AS num_languagesFROM countrylanguage clJOIN country c ON cl.countrycode = c.codeGROUP BY continentORDER BY num_languages DESC;```This query joins the `countrylanguage` and `country` tables on the `countrycode` column, and then groups the results by `continent` and counts the number of distinct `language` 1s for each group. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the number of languages.The output of this query would be a table with two columns: `continent` and `num_languages`. The `continent` column would contain the name of the continent, and the `num_languages` column would contain the number of languages spoken in each country on that continent. The result would look something like this:```+-------------+---------------+| continent   | num_languages |+-------------+---------------+| Asia        | 10            || Africa      | 9             || Europe      | 8             || Americas    | 7             || Oceania     | 6             || Antarctica  | 5             |+-------------+---------------+```This shows that Asia has the most diverse languages, with 10 different languages spoken in countries on that continent.

We can do this by joining the country and countrylanguage tables on the CountryCode column.Here is the SQL command to find the mean life expectancy of countries in which English is not the official language:```SELECT AVG(LifeExpectancy)FROM countryJOIN countrylanguage ON country.Code = countrylanguage.CountryCodeWHERE countrylanguage.Language = 'English' AND countrylanguage.IsOfficial = 0;```This command joins the country and countrylanguage tables on the CountryCode column, and then filters the results to only include countries where English is not the official language (i.e., where the Language column is 'English' and the IsOfficial column is 0). Finally, it calculates the mean life expectancy of these countries.Note that this command assumes that the LifeExpectancy column is in the country table, and that the Language and IsOfficial columns are in the countrylanguage table. If these columns are in a different table, you will need to modify the command accordingly.

We can do this by joining the two tables we just created, and then filtering the results to only include countries that have a population in Asia that is larger than the population of any country in Africa.```SELECT country.Code, country.Name, country.PopulationFROM countryJOIN (  SELECT country.Code, SUM(city.Population) AS Population  FROM country  JOIN city ON country.Code = city.CountryCode  WHERE country.Continent = 'Africa'  GROUP BY country.Code) AS AfricaPopulationON country.Code = AfricaPopulation.CodeWHERE country.Population > AfricaPopulation.Population;```This will give us a table with the country code, name, and population of each country in Asia that has a population that is larger than any country in Africa.Note that this query assumes that the country code is unique for each country, and that there are no duplicate entries in the city table for the same country. If there are, you may need to use a different join condition or aggregation function to ensure that the results are accurate.

medium pred: To find the number of high schoolers in each grade, you can use a SQL query that joins the Highschooler table with the Friend and Likes tables, and then groups the results by grade.Here is an example query:```SELECT h.grade, COUNT(DISTINCT h.ID) AS num_highschoolersFROM Highschooler hJOIN Friend f ON h.ID = f.student_idJOIN Likes l ON h.ID = l.student_idGROUP BY h.grade;```This query joins the Highschooler table with the Friend and Likes tables on the ID column, and then groups the results by grade. The COUNT(DISTINCT h.ID) function counts the number of distinct high schoolers in each grade.The result of this query will be a table with two columns: grade and num_highschoolers. The num_highschoolers column will contain the number of high schoolers in each grade.For example, if the Highschooler table contains the following data:```ID  name  grade1   John  12   Jane  13   Joe   24   Sarah 25   Tom   36   Lisa  3```And the Friend table contains the following data:```student_id  friend_id1           21           32           12           43           13           54           25           36           1```And the Likes table contains the following data:```student_id  liked_id1           21           32           12           43           13           54           25           36           1```Then the result of the query will be:```grade  num_highschoolers1      22      33      2```This means that there are 2 high schoolers in grade 1, 3 high schoolers in grade 2, and 2 high schoolers in grade 3.

It then groups the results by grade and counts the number of high schoolers in each grade. The results are then ordered in descending order by the number of high schoolers in each grade.The output of this query will be a table with two columns: grade and num_highschoolers. The grade column will contain the grade of each high schooler, and the num_highschoolers column will contain the number of high schoolers in that grade. The query will return the grade with the most high schoolers first, followed by the grade with the second most high schoolers, and so on.

It then uses a GROUP BY clause to group the results by grade, and a HAVING clause to filter the results based on the number of friends and likes. The COUNT(DISTINCT ...) functions are used to count the number of unique friends and likes for each grade.The query will return a table with three columns: grade, num_friends, and num_likes.

It then calculates the average grade of the students who have friends by taking the average of the `grade` column of the Highschooler table.Note that this query assumes that the `ID` column of the Highschooler table is the primary key and that the `student_id` column of the Friend table is the foreign key that references the `ID` column of the Highschooler table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

The `first_name` column will contain the first name of each owner, and the `name` column will contain the name of each dog.If you want to filter the results by a specific owner or dog, you can add a `WHERE` clause to the query. For example, to retrieve the first name and name of all owners who have a dog named "Buddy", you can use the following query:```SELECT o.first_name, d.nameFROM Owners oJOIN Dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_idWHERE d.name = 'Buddy';```This query will return a table with two columns: `first_name` and `name`.

It then filters the results to only include dogs of the rarest breed, which is determined by ordering the `breeds` table by the number of dogs in each breed and selecting the top row (i.e., the rarest breed). Finally, it joins the `treatments` table on the `dog_id` column to retrieve the treatment dates for each dog.Note that this query assumes that the `breed_code` column in the `dogs` table is a foreign key referencing the `breed_code` column in the `breeds` table.

extra pred: To find the rarest breed of dogs, we need to first find the number of dogs for each breed. We can do this by using a subquery to count the number of dogs for each breed.Here is the SQL command to find the rarest breed of dogs:```SELECT breed_name, COUNT(*) AS num_dogsFROM DogsJOIN Breeds ON Dogs.breed_code = Breeds.breed_codeGROUP BY breed_nameORDER BY num_dogs DESCLIMIT 1;```This command joins the `Dogs` and `Breeds` tables on the `breed_code` column, and then groups the results by `breed_name`. The `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of dogs for each breed, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the number of dogs in descending order. The `LIMIT 1` clause limits the results to only the rarest breed.The output of this command will be a table with two columns: `breed_name` and `num_dogs`.

hard pred: To find the most common singer citizenship, you can use a query that joins the singer and song tables on the Singer_ID column and groups the results by citizenship, counting the number of songs for each citizenship. Here's an example query:```SELECT citizenship, COUNT(*) AS num_songsFROM singerJOIN song ON singer.Singer_ID = song.Singer_IDGROUP BY citizenshipORDER BY num_songs DESC;```This query will return the citizenship of the most common singer, along with the number of songs they have recorded. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by citizenship, and the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows for each group. The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by the number of songs in descending order, so the most common singer is at the top.

medium pred: To retrieve the song titles and singer names, you can use the following SQL query:```SELECT s.Name, s.TitleFROM singer sJOIN song so ON s.Singer_ID = so.Singer_ID;```This query joins the `singer` and `song` tables on the `Singer_ID` column, and selects the `Name` and `Title` columns from the `singer` table and the `Title` column from the `song` table. The resulting table will have two columns: `Name` and `Title`.

medium pred: To find the names of the singers that have more than one song, you can use a SQL query that joins the singer and song tables on the Singer_ID column and groups the results by the Singer_ID. You can then use a HAVING clause to filter the results to only include singers with more than one song.Here is an example SQL query that should accomplish this:```SELECT s.NameFROM singer sJOIN song s2 ON s.Singer_ID = s2.Singer_IDGROUP BY s.Singer_IDHAVING COUNT(s2.Song_ID) > 1;```This query joins the singer and song tables on the Singer_ID column, groups the results by the Singer_ID, and then filters the results to only include singers with more than one song using the HAVING clause. The SELECT clause retrieves the Name column from the singer table, which is the name of the singer.Note that this query assumes that the Singer_ID column in the song table is a foreign key referencing the Singer_ID column in the singer table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

hard pred: To find the sname of every singer who does not have any song, you can use a SQL query like this:```SELECT s.NameFROM singer sLEFT JOIN song s ON s.Singer_ID = s.Singer_IDWHERE s.Song_ID IS NULL;```This query uses a `LEFT JOIN` to combine the `singer` and `song` tables on the `Singer_ID` column. The `WHERE` clause then filters out any rows where the `Song_ID` column is `NULL`, which means that the singer does not have any songs. The `SELECT` clause then extracts the `Name` column from the resulting rows, which gives you the sname of every singer who does not have any songs.

easy pred: To find the total number of available features, you can use a SQL query that joins the `Other_Available_Features` and `Ref_Feature_Types` tables on the `feature_type_code` column, and then uses the `COUNT()` function to count the number of rows in the resulting table.Here is an example query:```SELECT COUNT(*)FROM Other_Available_Features oafJOIN Ref_Feature_Types rft ON oaf.feature_type_code = rft.feature_type_code;```This query will return the total number of available features in the `Other_Available_Features` table, which is the number of rows in the resulting table.Note that this query assumes that the `feature_type_code` column in the `Other_Available_Features` table is a foreign key that references the `feature_type_code` column in the `Ref_Feature_Types` table. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.

medium gold: SELECT T2.feature_type_name FROM Other_Available_Features AS T1 JOIN Ref_Feature_Types AS T2 ON T1.feature_type_code  =  T2.feature_type_code WHERE T1.feature_name  =  "AirCon"

The `property_type_description` column from the `Ref_Property_Types` table is then selected and returned in the result set.

hard pred: To find the names of properties that are either houses or apartments with more than 1 room, you can use the following SQL query:```SELECT property_nameFROM PropertiesWHERE property_type_code IN ('H', 'A') AND room_count > 1;```This query uses the `IN` operator to check if the `property_type_code` is either 'H' (for house) or 'A' (for apartment), and the `>` operator to check if the `room_count` is greater than 1. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the `property_name` column from the `Properties` table.Note that this query assumes that the `property_type_code` column in the `Properties` table is a character column, and that the `room_count` column is an integer column. If these assumptions are not correct, you may need to modify the query accordingly.
hard gold: SELECT property_name FROM Properties WHERE property_type_code  =  "House" UNION SELECT property_name FROM Properties WHERE property_type_code  =  "Apartment" AND room_count  >  1
